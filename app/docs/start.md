Where to start
========

I use [Airtable:arrow_upper_right:](https://airtable.com/) to organize data. It's like a spreadsheet but with more features, like adding images. It comes with a mobile app, so you can easily upload photos from your phone and edit texts anywhere. Here are the [steps to set up Airtable](#doc/airtable) :wrench:

We start with setting the main topic. If you don't have one yet, don't worry, you can start with something trivial and change the topic as you design the cards. It can be about what you have on your desk or in your bag or what you are wearing on your skin or under your skin. What is important (to me) is not to miss small clues. The cozy restaurant you found on the road, the movie you watched the night before the rehearsal, ... they are everywhere.

From here, you can decide to start from photos or from the texts. However, they are just entry points, and you might want to switch back and forth as you create more cards.

By the way, how long does this process take?

You might have an album on the phone or a folder of random images collected from the Internet on your laptop. Then let's [start from photos](#doc/photos) :camera:

If you have some keywords in your notebook, or if you want to follow a certain naming convention (e.g., tarot), let's [start from texts](#doc/texts) :pen:
