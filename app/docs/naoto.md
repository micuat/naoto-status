I was born in Tsukuba, Japan in 1990. My family and I spent one year in Sydney, Australia in my first grade in the elementary school, and back in Japan, I grew up in Tsukuba and I continued studying in Tokyo in an engineering university. I spent 6 years in Canada initially for pursuing master's degree in engineering, and then I became an artist. Currently I am finishing my second master's at the Academy of Media Arts in Cologne, Germany, and I am creating this web publication.
