How to setup Airtable
--------

First, if you haven't made an account on Airtable, sign up with your email. (If you want to support this project, you can [sign up with my invite code](https://airtable.com/invite/r/vt3Outyp). Thanks!)

Airtable has Bases and Workspaces. A Base is like a project: for example, inspirations for a dance performance or memories from a family trip. A Workspace is a space for a team working on various projects, or Bases. It may be a collection of projects from the collective, or a set of family trips. To start, we can keep it simple; we start with a default Workspace and create a new Base.

Inside a Base, there are Tables. They are like spreadsheets, but let's stick to the default Table 1. Inside a Table, there are Views. Having 2 Views can be handy; a Grid view to see the overview of the records, and a Gallery view to present them like cards.

First, let's add an "attachment" field, where you can upload images (and any kind of files). In the table view, at the top right, there is a plus sign next to "Status". Click on the plus sign, select "attachment" and press "Create field".

To add a gallery view, find "Create..." menu at the bottom left and click on the plus sign next to "Gallery". Leave the default name and press "Create new view".
