Airtable has Bases and Workspaces. A Base is like a project: for example, inspirations for a dance performance or memories from a family trip. A Workspace is a space for a team working on various projects, or Bases. It may be a collection of projects from the collective, or a set of family trips. To start, we can keep it simple; we start with a default Workspace and create a new Base.

Inside a Base, there are Tables. They are like spreadsheets, but let's stick to the default Table 1. Inside a Table, there are Views. Having 2 Views can be handy; a Grid view to see the overview of the records, and a Gallery view to present them like cards.
