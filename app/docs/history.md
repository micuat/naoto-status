How I started making cards
========

In the frame of #TakeHeart residency, I started a project as a website, a non-linear autobiography where people can find their own narrative by discovering elements of my life. The early prototype can be seen on [dances.glitch.me:arrow_upper_right:](https://dances.glitch.me). Initially, I had Instagram in mind as an interface and I wanted to integrate a gamification aspect so that people earn "points" by finding the milestones in my life.

As I develop the project, I incorporated Windows 98-style interface, which I explored earlier for [ICADE:arrow_upper_right:](https://icade-test.glitch.me/) exhibition. The result is [soup.glitches.me:arrow_upper_right:](https://soup.glitches.me) and as you click on the icons, pop-up windows show up, and it reveals more icons. The turning point was when I had an opportunity to show the project in a physical space.
