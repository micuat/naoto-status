How I started making cards
========

In the frame of #TakeHeart residency, I started a project as an interactive website, a non-linear autobiography where people can find their own narrative by discovering elements of my life. The early prototype in August 2022 can be seen on [dances.glitch.me:arrow_upper_right:](https://dances.glitch.me). Initially, I had Instagram in mind as an interface and I wanted to integrate a gamification aspect on top of it so that people earn "points" by finding the milestones in my life.

As I develop the project, I incorporated Windows 98-style interface, which I explored earlier for [ICADE:arrow_upper_right:](https://icade-test.glitch.me/) exhibition. The result is [soup.glitches.me:arrow_upper_right:](https://soup.glitches.me) and as you click on the icons, pop-up windows show up, and it reveals more memories. While this was a web project, the turning point was when I had an opportunity to show the project in a physical space while studying as an exchange student in Bogot√°, Colombia in November 2022. Because it was in a context of performing arts and embodiment is the key, I did not want to simply print out a QR code and ask people to browse the webpage on their phones. Instead, I decided to format the windows into a grid of cards so that I can print them out and cut them on my own. Actually the idea of making cards have been in my agenda since I heard a story from [Tristan:arrow_upper_right:](https://tristanschulze.de/)

The printed cards have pros and cons compared to the interactive website format. The cards have physicality while on the website, related memories can be explored through clicking on hashtags. Both have different types of serendipity; shuffling revealing the next card on the deck, you might create your own narrative and clicking on a random hashtag, you might guess my intention behind connecting the two cards.

In Colombia, I made a few prototypes by cutting the printed sheets at the printshop by myself. This is quite fun and I recommend you to print your own cards following this tutorial. When I went back in Germany in 2023, I ordered new cards on [meinspiel.de:arrow_upper_right:](https://meinspiel.de) to have more "professional" look and printed double sided. Unfortunately the workflow is still quite cumbersome (for example, I need command-line tools to crop 55-page pdf). But if you want to get your cards printed professionaly, feel free to contact me (mail@naotohieda.com) and perhaps I can help you setting up the right format for print.
