Starting from photos
========

Whether on the mobile app of Airtable or the web browser, you can start to upload photos in the "attachment" field (on the computer, you can even drag and drop multiple images, but on the phone you have to be a bit more patient to create a new record and upload an image. Another note is that mobile upload often fails when you close the app before the upload is finished, so you have to be, again, patient).

Great :sparkles:

By the way, you don't have to curate the "best" photos of your trip or the production. The beauty of collectible or playing cards is that a deck consists of tens of cards, and every collector finds a different value in each card. You may have a blurry photo or a screenshot of Google Maps; if you find them somehow intriguing, let's add these images, too.

%%(Re)cognition%%

> Because I order printed cards on meinspiel.de, I aim for 55 cards in the end, which is one unit that they offer. But I would start with about 10 cards until I am clear about the theme and the direction of the deck :compass:

Now, we come up with names (titles) and texts. A name can be a word to a few words. It can be a sentence too, but I would keep it short to fit in the frame. It can be a number or in any language (I never experimented with right-to-left languages, though). A text can be a description of the image. In Magic: the Gathering, these texts are called *flavor text* because it doesn't affect the rulebook and is purely for telling the background story (if you want inspirations, searching for flavor text is a great starting point) :ice_cream:

I know, writing texts can be hard. But again, you don't need masterpiece poetry for each card. Who were you with and what were you talking about, looking at the scenery in the picture? Where, when and why did you buy that object in the photo? Would you take the photo in the same angle if you were in the same place a decade ago, or a decade later?

You can always leave some fields empty if you find it difficult to write. As you make more cards, you will probably come up with ideas later.

When you have, say 10 to 20 cards, lets start [linking](#doc/links) the cards :chains:
