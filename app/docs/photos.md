# Starting from photos

You might have an album on the phone or a folder of random images collected from the Internet on your laptop. Whether on the mobile app of Airtable or the web browser, you can start to upload photos in the "attachment" field (on the computer, you can even drag and drop multiple images, but on the phone you have to be a bit more patient to create a new record and upload an image. Another note is that mobile upload often fails when you close the app before the upload is finished, so you have to be, again, patient).
