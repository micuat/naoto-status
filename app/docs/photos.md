Starting from photos
========

You might have an album on the phone or a folder of random images collected from the Internet on your laptop. Whether on the mobile app of Airtable or the web browser, you can start to upload photos in the "attachment" field (on the computer, you can even drag and drop multiple images, but on the phone you have to be a bit more patient to create a new record and upload an image. Another note is that mobile upload often fails when you close the app before the upload is finished, so you have to be, again, patient).

Great :sparkles:

By the way, you don't have to curate the "best" photos of your trip or the production. The beauty of collectible or playing cards is that a deck consists of tens of cards, and every collector finds a different value in each card. You may have a blurry photo or a screenshot of Google Maps; if you find them somehow intriguing, let's add these images, too.

Because I order printed cards on meinspiel.de, I aim for 55 cards in the end. But I would start with about 10 cards until I am clear about the theme and the direction of the deck.

Now, we come up with names (titles) and texts. A name can be a word, a few words,
