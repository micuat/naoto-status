How I made 24-Hour Heartbreak Cards

%%24 Hour Deck%%

What is this?
--------

I ([Naoto:arrow_upper_right:](https://naotohieda.com)) started making my own collectible cards in 2022. Growing up with Pokemon Cards, Magic: the Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh! and other card games, it was always my dream to make my own card game. Although what I imagined in my childhood was full of dragons and spells, as an artist, I decided to make autobiographical cards, i.e., stories about my life. The project is ongoing and never reaches the end; I keep adding new cards whenever I can work on this project :running_woman:

This edition, 24-Hour Heartbreak Deck, is made between August 29 and 30, 2023, this time having a journal in mind rather than a biography. In my example, the focus was about self-reflection, but you can use this process to compile, for example, memories from your vacation :beach_umbrella: or a process of your latest dance performance :dolls:

This project is realized in the frame of Re-Coding Everyday Technology by the working group for unusual in- and output media / Hochschule Mainz. The original project is initiated as part of #TakeHeart residency in 2022, and I'd like to thank everyone who gave me valuable feedback, especially Lili and Valerie from #TakeMoreCare for giving me the initial direction for this particular edition.
