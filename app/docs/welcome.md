:fountain_pen: How I made 24-Hour Heartbreak Cards :yarn:

%%24 Hour Deck%%

What is this?
--------

I ([Naoto](#doc/naoto)) started making my own collectible cards in 2022. Growing up with Pokemon Cards, Magic: the Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh! and other card games, it was always my dream to make my own card game. Although what I imagined in my childhood was full of dragons and spells, as an artist, I decided to make autobiographical cards, i.e., stories about my life. The project is ongoing and never reaches the end; I keep adding new cards whenever I can work on this project :running_woman:

This edition, 24-Hour Heartbreak Deck, is made between August 29th and 30th, 2023, this time having a journal in mind rather than a biography. In my example, the focus was about self-reflection, but you can use this tutorial to compile, for example, memories from your vacation :beach_umbrella: or a process of your latest dance performance :dolls:

Let's [start](#doc/start) :rocket:

Or, do you want to first read the [story](#doc/history) behind the project? :books:
