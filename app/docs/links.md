There are several ways to organize cards. A conventional way is to make categories; but in this impromptu card-making process, I found it easier to link a card to another to create a network. It is inspired by [Zettelkasten :arrow_upper_right:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten).

(Of course, you can make categories, too. You can make a category in your Table, or my suggested method is to )
