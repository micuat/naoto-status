Starting from texts
========

I tend to start with collecting words for the cards, flesh them out with texts and images later. Concretely, when I have the theme of the card, I look up my harddrive for photos or go for a walk to take a picture that suits the card :telescope:

Let's start by typing names (or titles) and texts in Airtable. A name can be a word or a short sentence (but you want to keep it short that fits in the frame later). It can be a concrete object or a place; or abstract or intangible like emotions and sensations. It may be yourself or someone significant who you want to feature in the deck. Keep in mind that not all cards have to be a protagonist; you might want to also highlight the spider in the studio. They might turn out to be important in the next steps :spider:

Writing texts of the cards takes time, but it helps you understand what you really mean by the name especially when the card is about something intangible. For example, if the name of the card is "texture", is it about image, food, or both? If one card has several stories to tell, you can also make two cards with the same name and split the text.

> I recommend you to install Airtable app on your phone so whenever you come up with an idea, you can type it in, for example, while you're traveling on a train. But unfortunately not on the plane because the app requires Internet connection. In that case, I would type them in a note app and copy them later :airplane:

You can also switch to Gallery view by selecting it in the menu on the left. This may be a bit easier to edit the text and already give you an overview as cards :flower_playing_cards:

When you have, say 10 cards, lets start adding pictures. There are various approaches. You can look into the photos and images on your harddrive, go for a walk and take pictures, draw with a pen on a sheet of paper, use text-to-image AI service to generate an image, ... 
You don't have to finish all the texts and images; if you find some of them difficult, leave them and come back after the next steps.
