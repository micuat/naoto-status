Linking cards
========

There are several ways to organize cards. A conventional way is to make categories; but in this impromptu card-making process, I found it easier to link a card to another to create a network. It is inspired by [Zettelkasten:arrow_upper_right:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) method :card_index_dividers:

> Of course, you can make categories, too. You can make a category in your Table, or my suggested method is to add a category as a card, for example, "Colors", and link all the cards (such as Red, Pink and Blue) that belong to the category.
